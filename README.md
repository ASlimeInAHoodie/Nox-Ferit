# Nox Ferit

I pitched this mod idea to my friends and they said I should make it. Two days later here it is.

Nox Ferit is a configurable race against a shorter clock. At a certain time, the *Nox Oculus* will cause a spike in the maximum quantity of enemies that can appear inside, and all vents with monsters waiting to jump out will do so - instantly maxing out the new capacity. However, it's not all bad news - at least you get a multiplier to the quantity of scrap that can be found. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Nox Ferit requires BepInExPack as a dependency.<br>
> The scrap multiplier will most likely not work with other scrap-changing mods.
